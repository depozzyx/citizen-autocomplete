## VSCode setup

1. Go to the extensions store and search from `Lua` by `sumneko.lua`
2. Download it 
3. Press extension preferences button (right of uninstall)
4. Search for `Preload file Size` and set it to `2000` (Or at least more than `natives.lua` size)
5. Download [`natives.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/depozzyx/citizen-autocomplete/main/natives.lua) [(How to download?)](https://github.com/depozzyx/citizen-autocomplete/blob/main/how-to-download.md) from this repository
6. Open your project and drag `natives.lua` to whatever place you like. After a couple of seconds (depends on computer resources) Lua extension should analyse it and you are ready to go
