## VSCode setup

1. Go to the extensions store and search from `Lua` by `sumneko.lua`
2. Download it
3. Press extension preferences button (right of uninstall)
4. Search for `Preload file Size` and set it to `2000` (Or at least more than `natives.lua` size)
5. Download `natives.lua` from this repository, open your project and drag it to whatever place you like. After a couple of seconds (depends on computer resources) Lua extension should analyse it and you are ready to go
