## Resources

Theese are original and parsed by some criteria resourses that I used in this project. I am not the creator of the originals. If you are and you want more mention, we will add you somewhere else

## Creators of the resources

-   citizen_natives.lua - Lion | https://citizeniv.net/
-   scocl_natives.h - Alexander Blade
-   final_all_natives.h - parsed and polished by me, depozzyx

_By the way, `*.lua.ignore` is the same as `*.lua`, i've added `.ignore` not to harass my code editor with tones of code_
