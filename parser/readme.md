## Parser

Theese are all files, scripts, resources, etc. that I used to compile final result

How to use:

1. Install python 3 (preferably 3.8+ but some older versions might work too)
2. Go into parser directory `cd parser`
3. Install dependencies (requests and markdownify): `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `run.py`
