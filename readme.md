_If you have set it it up in code editor not listed here, feel free to open an issue and describe how you have done that_

## Notes
-   There are errors, feel free to tell us about them
-   Right now it's just a bunch of function defenitions which is not really optimised, so loading it can take a few seconds
-   By the way, if you've liked it, it would be great if you hit that star button on the top. Thanks!
