## How to use

The file you want in [`natives.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/depozzyx/citizen-autocomplete/main/natives.lua). Basically you need to download [(how to download?)](https://github.com/depozzyx/citizen-autocomplete/blob/main/how-to-download.md) and store it somewhere in you project, that way your code editor can analyse function defenitions and get code completion running.

More detailed explanations available for:

-   [VSCode](https://github.com/depozzyx/citizen-autocomplete/blob/main/setup.vscode.md)

_If you have set it it up in code editor not listed here, feel free to open an issue and describe how you have done it_

## Notes
-   There are probably errors, feel free to tell us about them
-   Right now it's just a bunch of function defenitions and is not optimised, so loading it can take a few seconds
-   By the way, if you've liked it, it would be great if you hit that star button on the top)
